\section{Research aim, objectives and research questions}

\subsection{Research aim}
The aim of this research proposal is to extend the functionality of the existing dublin traceroute tool in Go programming language. 
\subsection{Objectives}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Implement the state-of-the-art algorithms available, namely MDA-lite and Zeph algorithm. 
  \item Add support for TCP, ICMP and DNS probes. 
  \item Extend the functionality of the MDA and zeph alogrithms to also use IPv6.
  \item Evaluate the performance of the additional features added to dublin traceroute.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Research questions}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How effective is the improved dublin traceroute compared with the original implementation?
    \item What are the limitations of MDA-lite?
    \item What are the limitations of Zeph algortihm
    \item What benefit does extending the functionality of MDA-lite and Zeph to ipv6 with regards to available search space?
    \item What are the limitations of traceroute?
    \item What further improvements could be made?
    \item What novel contexts/use-cases
 could such a tool be implemented?
\end{enumerate}
